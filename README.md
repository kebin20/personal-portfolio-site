A single page personal portfolio website showcasing my own info, contact details and projects. 

The decision to build my site on NextJS is to make the project flexible for future implementations.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - A CSS Preprocessor
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
