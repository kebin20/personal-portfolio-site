                    This is a coffee beans ordering website, where users can
                    easily create a coffee subscription with their preferred
                    selection of beans. The website is built using React and
                    TypeScript, with routing facilitated via React Router, and
                    styled using CSS Modules.

                    users to review their selected options before finalizing
                    their order. In the future, there are plans to implement a
                    register and login page, as well as a shopping cart function
                    to enhance the user experience.

                    This is a flashcard app designed to help ES students revise
                    their vocabulary. The app is built using React and
                    TypeScript, with styling achieved through styled-components.
                    The main flashcard data is stored in Firebase, enabling easy
                    access and editing of deck layout and content.
                    Code was refactored by creating a custom hook to hold all the common business logic.

                  <span>
                    With this app, students can easily revise cards that require
                    further attention, as well as remove cards they have already
                    learned from their deck. It is highly accessible as students
                    will be able to access it not just on their school tablets,
                    but on their home devices as well.
