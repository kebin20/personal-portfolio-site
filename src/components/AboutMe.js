                  I&apos;ve been on my web development journey for almost a year
                  now, and it all started when I saw my friend&apos;s incredible
                  IDE setup for the first time. Witnessing the amazing things he
                  created motivated me to explore web development myself. The
                  timing was perfect too, since I had recently passed the
                  Japanese Language Proficiency Test (receiving the highest
                  rank, N1) and was eager to take on a new challenge in my free
                  time.

                  At first, web development seemed like a fun way to create
                  personal websites and explore the rewarding aspect of building
                  something from scratch. I&apos;ve always been fascinated by
                  technology, ever since I was young and tinkering with devices,
                  and I believe staying up-to-date with the latest tech is
                  crucial in today&apos;s world. These became my drive to study
                  hard in web development.

                  However, my journey wasn&apos;t without its challenges. As I
                  delved deeper into my studies, I struggled a lot with
                  JavaScript - and I still do! I&apos;ve had many hair-pulling
                  sessions trying to figure out why a piece of code isn&apos;t
                  working, whether it&apos;s a missing semicolon or a mistyped
                  name. But through these struggles, I&apos;ve learned a lot,
                  and I&apos;m still excited to keep learning more. While I know
                  there&apos;s still much more to learn, I feel more confident
                  in my skills than I did last year (trust me, my very first
                  website was terrible!).

                <span>
                  Right now, I&apos;m focusing on improving my front-end skills
                  and becoming more comfortable with it. Once I&apos;ve gained
                  more experience, I may explore the backend side of things. But
                  for now, one step at a time.{" "}
